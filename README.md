# Intro

Solution for Redux exercise done by Sergio Mart√≠n (sermmor). You could read the original version (without solution) in Lemoncode repository https://github.com/Lemoncode/redux-excercise/

The exercise consists in an application that displays a list of github members that belongs to an organization (in the starting excercise is hardcoded to lemoncode), and then add an input that will let the user change the organization name and query the members by clicking on the load button.
